# Penetration Testing Report  

This mock project contains a sample penetration testing report for a fictitious company. It demonstrates methodology, tools used, findings, and remediation recommendations.  

## Methodology  
- Scope definition and target identification  
- Reconnaissance and information gathering  
- Vulnerability scanning using tools like Nmap and Nessus  
- Exploitation and proof-of-concept attacks  
- Reporting of findings and risk ratings  

## Findings & Recommendations  
- **Sample Finding 1**: Unpatched web server vulnerability  
  - *Recommendation*: Apply vendor patches and implement web application firewall rules.  
- **Sample Finding 2**: Weak password policy  
  - *Recommendation*: Enforce strong password complexity and implement multi-factor authentication.  

This project is provided as a demonstration of how to structure and document a penetration test. Use it to showcase your ability to communicate technical findings effectively to stakeholders.
