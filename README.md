## 🕵️ OSINT Activities  
- **tookie-OSINT App** – Used tookie-OSINT to search for online presence via the terminal, illustrating practical OSINT skills and command-line proficiency.

- ## This playbook documents my reverse‑engineering workflow
- Update (Nov 7 2025): Added the MoveIT Clop Analysis Playbook (archived as a ZIP) to the repository. This playbook documents my reverse‑engineering workflow for analyzing the MoveIT Clop vulnerability—detailing tools used, steps taken to unpack and inspect the software, and key findings. Feel free to explore the archive to see the methodology in action and adapt the techniques for similar reverse‑engineering tasks.

## New Homelab Sysadmin Project (Nov 7 2025)
- – I’ve added a mock VMware-based homelab to showcase core entry-level system administration skills. In this project, I provision Windows and Linux VMs, configure a domain controller, create and manage users/groups, and implement least‑privilege permissions. It also includes automation examples using Bash, PowerShell, and Ansible. Check out the homelab‑vmware‑sysadmin‑samples folder in this repo for scripts, documentation, and setup notes.

# 🧠 Cybersecurity Awareness Training
I recently designed and delivered a **Cybersecurity Awareness Training** session to help my team strengthen their understanding of everyday cyber threats and how to protect both personal and organizational data.

This project is available here: [Cybersecurity Awareness Training Repository](https://github.com/ldenis001/Cybersecurity-Awareness-Training)

### 🔍 Overview
The training covered:
- Recognizing and reporting **phishing** and **social engineering** attempts  
- Understanding **ransomware**, **DNS spoofing**, and **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attacks  
- Reducing **financial fraud risk** through awareness and verification  
- Applying **risk management** practices, including cyber insurance  

### 🎯 Goal
To promote a culture of security mindfulness and empower non-technical team members with practical steps to safeguard data and systems.
