# Lazaro Denis – Cybersecurity Professional  

Hello! I'm Lazaro Denis (CyberLaz), a cybersecurity professional transitioning from a strong background in risk management and commercial insurance. I am certified in Google Cybersecurity and CompTIA Security+ and passionate about protecting systems and data. My mission is to help organizations anticipate, identify, and mitigate cyber threats.  

## 🔏 Skills & Tools  

- Network security, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing  
- Risk analysis and compliance frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)  
- Operating system hardening (Windows & Linux)  
- Python scripting for automation and debugging  
- Cloud security fundamentals  
- Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills  

## 💂 Featured Projects  

- **Penetration Testing Report** – A mock project documenting a penetration test methodology, findings, and remediation recommendations.  
- **Incident Response Plan** – A mock incident response plan illustrating preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.  
- **Log Analysis Automation** – Scripts and documentation for automating log collection and analysis to detect anomalies and threats.  
- **Copy of Certificates** – A repository containing my professional certifications in cybersecurity and related fields.  
- **OS Hardening** – A project demonstrating best practices for hardening operating systems against common threats.  
- **Network Hardening** – Hands-on exercises for securing networks and responding to incidents.  
- **Compliance Risk Assessment** – A case study where I performed a risk assessment for a fictitious company to evaluate compliance readiness.  
- **Python Debugging & Automation** – Scripts and lab work focused on debugging Python applications and improving code efficiency and accuracy.

- ## 🧩 Security Operations Projects

- **Azure Sentinel Log Correlation Lab** – Built and configured Microsoft Sentinel to collect and analyze security events from a homelab. Created analytics rules and workbooks to detect RDP brute-force and privilege escalation attempts.
- **Splunk Threat Hunting Dashboard** – Developed a Splunk dashboard to visualize event logs and detect suspicious PowerShell and Sysmon activity.
- **Nessus Vulnerability Scan Automation** – Automated scanning and reporting using Nessus Essentials and PowerShell for remediation workflows.

## 🗜️ Certifications
- **Microsoft SC-200: Security Operations Analyst (2024)**
- **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** – valid through Oct 6 2028  
- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate (2024)**
- **NIST RMF Certified (FISMA, CSF, SCRM, 800-37, 800-53)**  
- **Vulnerability Management Detection & Response (2024)**
- **PCI Compliance (2024)**
I continuously pursue new learning opportunities to stay current with evolving threats.

## 🕵️ OSINT Activities  
- **tookie-OSINT App** – Used tookie-OSINT to search for online presence via the terminal, illustrating practical OSINT skills and command-line proficiency.

- ## This playbook documents my reverse‑engineering workflow
- Update (Nov 7 2025): Added the MoveIT Clop Analysis Playbook (archived as a ZIP) to the repository. This playbook documents my reverse‑engineering workflow for analyzing the MoveIT Clop vulnerability—detailing tools used, steps taken to unpack and inspect the software, and key findings. Feel free to explore the archive to see the methodology in action and adapt the techniques for similar reverse‑engineering tasks.

## 🧠 Hands-On Labs
- **Windows Event Log Triage:** Used Sysmon + PowerShell to identify failed login patterns and malicious processes.
- **Threat Hunting Simulation:** Conducted attack detection exercises in Azure Sentinel, documenting correlation logic and mitigations.
- **Vulnerability Scan & Patch:** Scanned a homelab using Nessus and patched identified CVEs, documenting findings.

# 🧠 Cybersecurity Awareness Training
I recently designed and delivered a **Cybersecurity Awareness Training** session to help my team strengthen their understanding of everyday cyber threats and how to protect both personal and organizational data.

This project is available here: [Cybersecurity Awareness Training Repository](https://github.com/ldenis001/Cybersecurity-Awareness-Training)

### 🔍 Overview
The training covered:
- Recognizing and reporting **phishing** and **social engineering** attempts  
- Understanding **ransomware**, **DNS spoofing**, and **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attacks  
- Reducing **financial fraud risk** through awareness and verification  
- Applying **risk management** practices, including cyber insurance  

### 🎯 Goal
To promote a culture of security mindfulness and empower non-technical team members with practical steps to safeguard data and systems.
