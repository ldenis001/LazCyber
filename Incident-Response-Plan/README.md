# Incident Response Plan  

This mock project provides an incident response plan template for security teams. It outlines the key phases of handling a security incident, from preparation to lessons learned.  

## Plan Phases  
- **Preparation**: Establish policies, communication channels, and train staff.  
- **Identification**: Detect and confirm incidents through monitoring and alerting.  
- **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to limit damage.  
- **Eradication**: Remove malicious artifacts and vulnerabilities.  
- **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operations and monitor for reoccurrence.  
- **Lessons Learned**: Document the incident, analyze response effectiveness, and improve processes.  

Use this template to showcase your ability to design structured, repeatable processes for incident response.
