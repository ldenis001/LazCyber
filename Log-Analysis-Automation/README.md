# Log Analysis Automation  

This mock project demonstrates how to automate the collection and analysis of logs across multiple systems to detect anomalies and security threats.  

## Project Overview  

Organizations generate massive volumes of logs from servers, applications, and network devices. Manual review is time-consuming and error-prone. This project includes Python scripts and documentation that automate log parsing, pattern detection, and alerting.  

### Features  

- Automated collection of logs from Linux servers using secure protocols  
- Parsing of common log formats (syslog, Apache, auth logs)  
- Pattern matching and anomaly detection to identify suspicious activity (e.g., brute-force attempts, failed logins)  
- Generation of summary reports and real-time alerts via email or messaging  
- Modular design to extend to new log sources or detection rules  

### Getting Started  

This project is a conceptual demonstration. Clone the repository and explore the scripts in the `scripts/` directory. Customize the configuration file to point to your log sources. Then run the main script to initiate the analysis pipeline.  

### What I Learned  

Through this mock project, I gained deeper familiarity with log formats, Python's logging and regex modules, and the importance of automation in security operations.
